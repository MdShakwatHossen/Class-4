      Bangladesh officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in
      South Asia. It is the eighth-most-populous country in the world, with a
      population of around 169 million people in an area of 148,460 square
      kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh is among the most densely populated
      countries in the world, and shares land borders with India to the west,
      north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the south it has a
      coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated from Bhutan
      and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by the Indian state of
      Sikkim in the north. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's
      political, financial and cultural centre. Chittagong, the second-largest
      city, is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal. The official language is
      Bengali, one of the easternmost branches of the Indo-European language
      family.

      Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic
      region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of India in 1947.
      The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was known as
      Gangaridai and was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms. Muslim conquests
      after 1204 heralded the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an
      independent Bengal Sultanate and a wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the
      region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy.
      After 1757, Bengal's administrative jurisdiction reached its greatest
      extent under the Bengal Presidency of the British Empire. The creation of
      Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of
      Bangladesh. In 1940, the first Prime Minister of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq
      supported the Lahore Resolution. Before the partition of Bengal, a Bengali
      sovereign state was first proposed by premier H. S. Suhrawardy. A
      referendum and the announcement of the Radcliffe Line established the
      present-day territorial boundary of Bangladesh.

      In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of
      Pakistan. It was renamed as East Pakistan, with Dhaka becoming the
      country's legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952; the
      East Bengali legislative election, 1954; the 1958 Pakistani coup d'Ã©tat;
      the six point movement of 1966; and the 1970 Pakistani general election
      resulted in the rise of Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements in
      East Pakistan. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer
      power to the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the
      Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, in which the Mukti Bahini aided by
      India waged a successful armed revolution. The conflict saw the Bangladesh
      genocide and the massacre of pro-independence Bengali civilians, including
      intellectuals. The new state of Bangladesh became the first
      constitutionally secular state in South Asia in 1972. Islam was declared
      the state religion in 1988. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court
      reaffirmed secular principles in the constitution.
